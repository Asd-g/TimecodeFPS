# TimecodeFPS
AviSynth plugin to convert VFR to CFR using MKV timecodes

## What's new
* Add 64-bit binary.
* Update to AviSynth+ 3.5 library.

## What's new (2021-09-22)
* Created Visual Studio 2019 solution and removed GCC .mak files
* Can now pass multiple timecode files by separating them with a semicolon, for example if you are loading multiple videos with absolute timestamp values and concatenating them and you want to preserve a continuous FPS across multiple files.
